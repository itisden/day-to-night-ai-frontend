            This website serves a specific purpose, offering users the
            functionality to upload an image depicting the external view of a
            residential property. The main objective of this platform is to
            undergo a transformation of the uploaded image from its original
            daytime appearance into a representation that simulates a nighttime
            scene.

            Users visiting this website are provided with the option to submit a
            photograph that captures the external fa√ßade of a house. The
            uploaded image, which typically showcases the building under
            daylight conditions, serves as the input for a unique digital
            process.
